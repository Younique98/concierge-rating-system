# **Feature Brief: Point.me Reviews System**

## **1. Feature Goals**

The primary objective is to build a **secure, scalable, and user-friendly review
system** that allows:

1. Users to fetch & display reviews.
2. Users to submit reviews with star ratings.
3. Security mechanisms to prevent spam & abuse.

## **2. Success Criteria**

- Reviews should load in **<500ms** for optimal user experience.
- Users should receive **immediate feedback** when submitting a review.
- API should reject **spam, invalid input, and excessive requests** to maintain
  data integrity.

## **3. Key Considerations**

- **Security:** Implement rate limiting, CSRF protection, and input validation.
- **Performance:** Use caching, lazy loading, and pagination to optimize API
  efficiency.
- **Scalability:** Design the system to accommodate **thousands of concurrent
  users**.
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Ensure alignment with Product, Design, and
  Engineering teams.

## **4. Cross-Functional Collaboration & Stakeholder Engagement**

### **Stakeholders & Communication Strategy**

To ensure seamless execution, I will collaborate with:

- **Product Management:** To align technical implementation with business
  objectives.
- **Design Team:** To validate UI/UX consistency with the overall user
  experience.
- **Backend Engineers:** To coordinate API contracts and ensure efficient data
  flow.
- **Security & Compliance:** To implement best practices in authentication, data
  protection, and API security.

### **Key Collaboration Methods**

**Regular Standups & Syncs** → Weekly engineering meetings to discuss
implementation progress.  
 **Tech Design Reviews** → Present system architecture, security measures, and
scalability plans to stakeholders.  
 **Feedback Loops** → Gather input from product managers and designers to refine
feature implementation.  
 **Documentation & Transparency** → Maintain clear API contracts and update
stakeholders via Notion or Confluence.

## **5. Open Questions & Risks**

- **How will we handle review moderation for inappropriate content?**
- **Should reviews be linked to user authentication for better data integrity?**
- **What level of caching (client-side vs. server-side) should be implemented to
  balance performance and consistency?**

## **6. Future Considerations**

- **OAuth Authentication:** Allow users to submit reviews only if logged in.
- **GraphQL API:** More flexible querying options for frontend efficiency.
- **Real-Time Updates:** WebSockets for live review submissions.
